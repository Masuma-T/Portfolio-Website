# Portfolio-Website
Personal portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and experience.
# 🌐 Website Project  

This is a practice website I built while learning web development. It allowed me to explore different front-end techniques, improve my design skills, and gain experience with responsive layouts.  

## ✨ Features  
- Fully **responsive layout** that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens  
- **Functional navigation links** for smooth browsing  
- **Custom graphic design with sunflowers 🌻**   
- Clean and minimal layout inspired by portfolio-style websites  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** for styling and responsiveness (media queries, flexbox, custom backgrounds)  
- **JavaScript (vanilla)** for small interactive elements (typing effect, toggles, etc.)  
- **Graphic Design Tools** (for editing the profile picture and sunflower effect)  

## 📖 What I Learned  
- How to structure a personal/portfolio-style website  
- Using **CSS media queries** to make layouts responsive  
- Experimenting with positioning and image editing for custom design elements  
- Practice with **GitHub workflow** (pushing, committing, and hosting on GitHub Pages)
